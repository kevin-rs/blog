Hey AI pioneers and Rustaceans,

We've been told again and again that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is something for the distant future, maybe decades away, and only something giant companies with endless money and server farms can ever pull off. But here at Kevin RS, we're saying "no thanks" to that slow-moving mindset, because we believe AGI doesn't need to wait. Kevin RS is our mission, our manifesto, and our platform - all wrapped into one fully open-source toolkit built in pure Rust. This project is meant for people who care about doing things right, building agents that can think and act independently, and running them at a level of performance and safety that most modern stacks simply can't reach. Kevin RS isn't about chasing hype - it's about solving real problems, moving fast without breaking things, and building something that's meant to last. If you've ever been frustrated with janky Python scripts that break when one cloud service goes down, or tired of agents that need hand-holding to finish even simple tasks, or annoyed that your "autonomous AI" only works in one very specific context, Kevin RS is your way out of that mess. It's designed to be provider-agnostic, ultra-flexible, and completely free for anyone to build with. It's more than just a codebase - it's a movement. And the future of general intelligence belongs to builders like you.

## Why Kevin RS?

Kevin RS exists because we got tired of toy-like "AI agents" that only work in demos or need everything hard-coded just to get through a basic task. This isn't just a tool - it's a framework for people who want to build AGI seriously, and that means we've taken a different approach from the ground up. Most agent frameworks lock you into specific cloud providers or APIs, and when those services change, your entire stack breaks - but Kevin RS is provider-agnostic, which means you can switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, or even self-hosted models without rewriting your app. That's not just a nice-to-have; it's essential if you care about long-term resilience and flexibility. It also supports fault-tolerant, multi-tenant execution, meaning you can spin up and run dozens (or even hundreds) of AI agents at once without them crashing each other or interfering with your system. The agents use zero-shot reasoning, which means you don't need to manually tell them how to do every little task - they learn what they need to do from the prompt and available tools. Rust helps make all this fast and reliable, because the language gives us "zero-cost abstractions", so we don't pay any speed penalty for using powerful tools like async tasks, memory-safe types, and advanced trait systems. If you've ever waited ten seconds for a Python bot to do something you know should take half a second - or if you've watched a container crash because some library silently failed - then you already know why Kevin RS matters. It gives you control, speed, and stability, all in one toolkit, and it's finally time for AI agents to grow up and be treated like real software - not toys.

## Built in Pure Rust

We are building Kevin RS in Rust not because it's trendy or cool (although it is), but because it solves problems that other languages just don't touch. Rust is a systems programming language that gives you the kind of raw power you'd get from C or C++, but with a safety model that helps you catch mistakes before you ever run your code. That's incredibly important when you're building complex systems like AGI agents that might be running for hours, days, or even weeks without stopping. In Rust, you can't have null pointer bugs, buffer overflows, or race conditions unless you really go out of your way to ignore the rules - and those rules are built into the compiler. When you write in Rust, the language actually helps you think through memory management, ownership, concurrency, and more, which makes your code safer and easier to maintain in the long run. Rust also allows for "fearless concurrency", meaning you can write multi-threaded applications without worrying about data races, and that makes it ideal for running lots of AI agents at the same time without everything slowing down or crashing. One of the most amazing things about Rust is that all these safety features don't slow your code down - in fact, it compiles into extremely fast machine code that often beats C in benchmarks. And because of its "zero-cost abstraction" philosophy, you can use high-level tools without any performance hit. Rust also has a package manager called `Cargo`, which is incredibly easy to use and lets you build, test, and share your code with almost no setup. In a world where agents need to be fast, robust, and capable of learning on their own, Rust gives us the foundation we need to make that happen - and that's why Kevin RS is being built on it from the ground up.

## The AutoGPT Framework

At the heart of Kevin RS is a powerful and flexible AutoGPT framework that turns language models into real agents that can act, learn, and evolve. Unlike many frameworks where the "autonomy" is just a loop that calls an LLM over and over, our AutoGPT engine is built for real-world workloads, with a full execution engine that supports retrying failed tasks, managing long-running state, and selecting tools dynamically based on what's needed. When you build an agent in Kevin RS, you can easily plug in the tools it needs - like web search, math solvers, or code execution - and those tools can be written in Rust or exposed over a local or remote API. Here's how easy it is to get started:

```rust
// TODO: Release
let agent = AutoGPTBuilder::default()
    .with_provider(Provider::Gemini)
    .with_model(Model::Flash20)
    .tools(vec![Tool::Search, Tool::Calculator])
    .build()?;

let task = Message::User {
    content: Content::Text("Create a weather forecast website for global cities.".to_string()),
    name: None,
};

match agent.run(vec![task]).await {
    Ok(response) => {
        println!("{}", response);
    }
    Err(err) => {
        eprintln!("Agent error: {:?}", err);
    }
}
```

That's it. No boilerplate, no messy Python glue, no fragile shell scripts. Everything runs fast and smoothly right inside your app, with full error handling, and safety guards built in. And because the entire stack is written in Rust, you get tight control over performance and safety, which matters a lot when your agents are running long workflows or managing sensitive data. The best part is that AutoGPT in Kevin RS is not just a proof of concept - it's production-grade software, ready to be used in everything from AGI research labs to developer tools to autonomous robots. It's not just smarter, it's powerfully built.

## Kevin AGI: The Web App (Coming Soon)

We know not everyone wants to live in a terminal or build their own interface, so we're working on something truly exciting: a full-featured web app called Kevin that will let you interact with your AI agents through an easy-to-use interface. This app will make it possible to create, run, and monitor autonomous agents right from your browser, with tools for task chaining, visual debugging, and live feedback. It's designed to make AGI research feel more like using an IDE - and it will support everything from natural language task submission to plug-and-play tool integration. You'll be able to assign tasks like "generate a research paper", "monitor my open-source issues", or "auto-deploy my web app" and have the agents not only understand but _act_ on those requests. The app is fully open-source and will be easy to self-host or extend, so whether you're a solo hacker or running a whole AGI team, you'll be able to make Kevin your own. We're targeting an early alpha by summer 2025, and we're building it with the same values that power the Rust ecosystem: speed, reliability, safety, and full control for the user.

## Why Rust for AGI?

People often ask: "Why not Python for AGI? Isn't that what everyone else uses?" And yes, Python is popular - but for AGI, we need more than just popularity. We need performance, predictability, and reliability, and that's exactly where Rust shines. With tools like Cargo, you get a single command that can compile, test, lint, and deploy your code, all with consistent results every time. Unlike Python, which often fails at runtime due to import errors, version mismatches, or memory leaks, Rust gives you compile-time confidence that your agents will behave the way you expect. It also lets you pick and choose features at build time, so you don't end up with bloated binaries or unexpected dependencies. There's no garbage collector, so you don't get random pauses in your agents when memory gets tight, which is a big deal for real-time systems or high-speed loops. And the Rust ecosystem is full of mature, reliable libraries - from Tokio for async web servers to Yew for modern frontends - that make it easy to build complete systems without leaving the Rust universe. At the end of the day, Rust gives you control, clarity, and confidence - three things you definitely want when building general intelligence.

## Community & Contribution

If you're doing research or publishing papers on agent behavior, cognition, or AGI theory, we'd love to collaborate and highlight your work. Kevin RS was built with transparency in mind - we believe that the future of intelligence should be open, fair, and built for everyone, not locked behind paywalls or controlled by tech giants. By joining this project, you're not just writing code - you're shaping the future of how intelligence works.

## Roadmap: AGI When?

Our big goal is bold, but we believe in it: we want to show off a working, general-purpose AI agents - capable of real-world learning, research synthesis, and self-improvement - by summer 2025. To do that, we're focusing on four major milestones. First, we're shipping AutoGPT 0.2.0, which will include a richer tool ecosystem, smarter decision-making loops, and better memory handling. Second, we're releasing Kevin - the web app UI that will make it easy to build, test, and share AGI workflows without touching code. Third, we're launching a benchmark suite that will allow researchers to test their agents on real tasks and compare results on global leaderboards. And finally, we're developing new kinds of specialized agents - ones that can write code, prove theorems, debug other agents, and even build their own internal models of the world. These milestones aren't just dreams - they're all in progress. And if we hit them, we'll be one giant step closer to open, safe, usable AGI for everyone.
